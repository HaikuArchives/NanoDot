  Description: Binary & source for a simple MIDI sequencer
        Notes: nanodot is a rather minimal pattern-based MIDI
               sequencer for BeOS R3. Its main purpose in life
               was/is to teach me (and hopefully others) the
               basics of writing MIDI apps for BeOS; it makes
               for a nice drum-programming 'scratchpad', and is a
               generally entertaining way to waste a few hours.

               1.1b Change Log:

               . Several bug fixes, including proper MIDI-port
                 detection.

               . Track context menu (right-click on any empty
                 part of a track row) provided a few simple
                 editing commands.

               . Playback position indicators.

               . Support for the internal BeOS synth.
